<h1>Happy Valentine’s Day, Cupcake 💖</h1>
<p><b>Since 23 September ❤️</b></p>

<p>
Out of billions of people in this world, somehow our paths crossed —
and that became my favourite coincidence.
</p>

<p>
If there were infinite timelines,
I would still find my way back to you every single time.
</p>

<p>
You are not just part of my life.
You are the part that makes everything feel right.
</p>

<div class="quote">
Pink skies, blue dreams, and you — my favourite forever.

<h1>To The Love Of My Life</h1>

<p>
I don’t think you realize how quietly you took up space in my life. It wasn’t sudden, it wasn’t loud. It just happened naturally. One day, you were someone I talked to, and without noticing, you became someone I needed to hear from.
You turn ordinary moments into little sparks I look forward to. A notification from you makes my day. Talking to you never feels forced or empty. It feels like home, even through a screen.
</p>

<p>
Even quiet moments feel brighter knowing you exist somewhere in the same world as me. Songs remind me of you. Places make me wish you were there. I like how naturally you live in my thoughts.
Distance doesn’t change this. If anything, it makes me more certain. This isn’t about convenience. It’s about choosing you over and over again.
</p>

<p>
With you I don’t have to pretend.
I can just be myself and somehow that is enough.
Distance doesn’t change how I feel.
If anything, it makes me more certain.
</p>

<p>
I don’t know exactly what the future looks like, but I know I want you in it. Laughing with me, talking with me, existing beside me. Not just as a memory, but as my person.
So this Valentine’s Day, and every ordinary day, I’m choosing you. Quiet evenings, random afternoons, moments when nothing happens except you being in my heart. I’m choosing you. Always.
</p>

<p class="sig">Yours in every lifetime ❤️</p>
